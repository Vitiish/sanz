        <b>🔰THE SHOSHINSHA MARK🔰</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <img class="imgstyle" src="/MEDIA/mark.jpg">
        <br>
        <br>
        The shoshinsha mark (初心者マーク) or Wakaba mark (若葉マーク), officially Beginner Drivers' Sign (初心運転者標識, Shoshin Untensha Hyōshiki), is a green and yellow V-shaped symbol that new drivers in Japan must display at the designated places at the front and the rear of their cars for one year after they obtain a standard driver's license. Drivers who consider themselves beginners may continue to display the sign, even after the period of a year. Like the orange and yellow "fukushi mark" or "kōreisha mark" that denotes elderly drivers, the shoshinsha mark is designed to warn other drivers that the marked driver is not very skilled, either due to inexperience or old age.
        <br>
        <br>
        In Japan the shoshinsha mark is also used beyond the driving context to indicate beginner status. In Tochigi, for example, new mothers are issued a card with the mark on it to indicate their experience level to health and child care support staff. New employees of companies may also have the mark on their name badges until they become more experienced.In video games, it is associated with tutorials and new players. In the anime Sgt. Frog, the character Tamama has a mirrored shoshinsha mark on his hat and stomach.

        <b>THE KOREISHA MARK</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <img class="imgstyle" src="/MEDIA/Kourei_mark.svg.png">
        <br>
        <br>
        The Kōreisha mark (高齢者マーク, elderly car mark) is a statutory sign that is set up in the Road Traffic Law of Japan to indicate "aged person at the wheel". Its official name is "aged driver sign" (高齢運転者標識, kōrei untensha hyōshiki).
        Koreisha mark, from February 2011
        <br>
        <br>
        The law decrees that when a person who is aged 70 and over drives a car and if their old age could affect the driving, they should endeavor to display this mark on both the front and rear of the car. Drivers aged 75 and over are obliged to display the mark.
        <br>
        <br>
        Conversely, the green and yellow shoshinsha mark (also called wakaba mark) denotes new drivers. Both marks are designed to warn other drivers that the marked driver is not very skilled, either due to inexperience or old age.

        <b>WHY ARE JAPANESE CARS LIMITED TO 112MPH/180KMH?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <img class="imgstyle" src="/MEDIA/Japanese-Gentlemans-Agreement.jpg">
        <br>
        <br>
        This was part of the “Gentleman's Agreement” between auto manufacturers under JAMA back in 1989, that also saw them cap the horsepower of their sports cars to 280 ps. (276 hp)
        <br>
        <br>
        This was in order to address an epidemic of road deaths in Japan in the 1980's, due to concerns over excessive speed. The 276 hp limit has been rescinded, but the speed limiter has not.
        <br>
        <br>
        A similar thing happened with Sports Bikes at the end of the 90's, with the most powerful ones equipped with a 300 km/h limiter. Though how 300 km/h is less deadly than any number above that is unknown.
        <br>
        <br>
        The 180 km/h limiter for sports cars is still well below the capacity of most sports cars and even non-sports cars with larger engines. Many four cylinder “family sedans” from Japan can do 210-220 km/h, and bigger engined Japanese cars just under the 276 hp limit are capable of 240 km/h when de-restricted. But with no speed limits in Japan above 120 km/h, capping them at 180 km/h ensures that while they have extra speed for emergencies, they aren't going that much faster than regular traffic.
        <br>
        <br>
        At 300 km/h, a bike is going fast enough relative to a car going 100 km/h to get someone killed if the two should meet.
