        <br>
        Mazada later produced the four-door sports car successor Mazda RX-8 concept car in 2001 first seen at the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit, Cobo Hall.
        <br>
        The Mazada RX-8 was built with 250-horsepower Renesis rotary engine the latest version of the official wankel engine originally developed by Felix Wankel. To clarify the Renesis rotary engine was simply a redesigned engine of the Wankel 13B-MSP. The 13B-MSP Renesis engine is a naturally aspirated (NA) engine with two exhaust ports per the (two-rotor) layout making them different from the Mazada RX-7. The Mazada RX-7 has only one exhaust port and can be compared to the high performance 250 hp, lightweight Mazada RX-8 13B-MSP Renesis engine with an extra exhaust port.
